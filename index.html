        <pre>
            
            1. Rinse the split peas to remove any impurities and transfer them to the pressure cooker.
            2. Add cooking oil and the beef bones to a pan and then brown them. Add 2 spoons of barbacue spice
               to the bones as they are frying. Transfer the bones to the pressure cooker when they are done.
            3. Roughly chop your onion and garlic and fry them in the same pan you used to brown the bones.
               Scrape the flavour of the beef bones from the bottom of the pan as you are frying the onion and
               garlic. Add your 1/2 tsp of rajah and 1 tbsp of chicken spice. Transfer to the pressure cooker.
            4. Add 1.7 litres of boiling water, 1 beef stock cube and 1 tbsp of benny for taste in the pressure cooker.
               Mix everything together and then cook for 25-30 min (until the peas are soft) under high pressure.
            5. When the peas are soft, transfer the contents of the pressure cooker to a pot. Add your white onion
               soup and benny/salt until your soup is well-seasoned. Allow the soup to simmer for 5 minutes.
            6. Served best with dombolo (steamed bread). Click <a href="https://www.thesouthafrican.com/lifestyle/food/recipes/dombolo/">here</a> for the recipe. ENJOY!
